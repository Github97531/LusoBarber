The application was developed in the context in which most people use mobile devices to perform daily tasks, and the services provided by barbershops are quite in demand. In this way, "Barbearia Lus√≥fona" intends to offer its customers the convenience of booking haircuts and purchasing barbershop products directly through the application, in addition to providing a catalog of cuts to help when choosing a new look.
The report will address functional and non-functional requirements, methodology used in the development of the application, the architecture and implementation of the solution, the tests carried out and the results obtained, as well as the conclusions and lessons learned from the throughout the project. The report is also intended to be useful to others developers who are working on similar projects.
